# Notes

## Objective
Create a healthy space for fruitful discussion. Gamify discourse

## Governing Rules of Conversation
a. There are two sides, each with a stance opposing the other.
b. Sides take turns advancing their point.
c. no cussing, slander or hate speech (you will receive a strike) [Maybe using AI, ex. "this is a strawman argument, not good". Moderators?]
d. 300 characters per message (maybe more, want actual points not sentence)

## Ideas
Vote for response in conversations of 3 or more people
	- A side of multiple people can each submit a response and vote on one of their response to send as rebuttal

Neutral Zone Comments
	- If you have a comment that sits on the fence, isn't on the left or right, you can submit as "no side" and the comment will 
		appear in the middle of the conversation page.

Choose side
- At the beginning of the conversation, choose a side. Then each message you sent, it is assumed you are on that side BUT you can switch sides or post a neutral zone comment. 

One side wins
- Conversation automatically ends if all participants end up on one side OR if both sides back the same position

Switching sides 
- Give user the ability to switch side

## Hutch's comments
- Set time limit for each side to respond.

## Garrett's comments
- You might be limiting yourself with only two sides.

- When it comes to specific conversations (maybe a bit more dark), it might be useful to start off with some messages providing nuance, not taking a specific side out the gate. Say one person on one side proposes an amendment to the position of that side

- Amendments to position. Allow a side to change their position or restate their position (producing change to the conversation)

- provide ability to share links, specifically to back up claims ("40% of americans are stupid" <-- Message sent saying "back this claim up" maybe)

- create structure for conversations. 
  - DEBATE STYLE
    1. opening arguments
    2. questioning period after each opening argument
    3. response round
    4. optional: final statements
  - A participant can suggest a vote to enter into a question round. Each side asks x questions and each side must provide response to each question before continuing
  - "this is cool as shit" -Gman

- If this gets big, go for cameos (ie. celebrities, public figures, politicians) to have conversations. "__ and __ will have a conversation on Let's Talk from (day1) to (day2), follow"
